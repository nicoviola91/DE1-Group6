**How to run docker-compose setup:**

1. Go to /docker-setup folder
2. Do <code>docker-compose up –build</code>.
3. Go to localhost/8888 for jupyter, if it’s not there you need to find the port by doing <code>docker-compose ps</code> and look for the jupyter node.

**Data analys**

The files that we used for analyzing are in /data-analysis.

**Note:**
Our old docker-compose file is in /spark-original and our try for making separate worker and master is in /separate-worker.
